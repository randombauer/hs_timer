Things TODO in the near future:

       - Implement the gtk screen grab properly from
         http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&file=faq23.039.htp
	 or switch to PIL (win only apperently)
         http://effbot.org/imagingbook/imagegrab.htm

       - Implement a way to select a screen area and save that to config to
         avoid relying on hard coded pixel values

       - Find a good median for button colours/a way to dynamically determine
         them instead of using hardocded stuff

       - Restructure project

       - Display times next to button in game instead of in window (low prio)

       - Be easily able to recover from timer failures due to errornous colour
         detection, broken turn button in game etc.
